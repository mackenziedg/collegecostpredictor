# College Cost Predictor

## Purpose

Using the [US College Scorecard][scorecard_link], we seek to provide insights to students on their long-term prospects based off of their choice of schools. Using R, we perform analysis on the last 15 years of college scorecard data. We then encapsulate what we learned in the EDA phase into the [ShinyDebt][shinydebt_url] app, using R's Shiny framework for web applications.
